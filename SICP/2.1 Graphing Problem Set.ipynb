    "One of the things that makes Scheme different from other common\n",

    "To keep track of this, it will be helpful to have some simple notation\n",
    "to describe types of Scheme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two basic types of values are , the Scheme numbers such as 3, -4.2,\n",
    "6.931479453e89, and , the truth values `#t,#f`. The procedure `square`\n",
